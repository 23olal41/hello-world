This is the first part of creating my Github account
I'm Alejandro Olivo, I was born on Tulsa, Oklahoma, in December 26th of 2003, and now I live here.
When I was a child, in Venezuela I didn't know how all the assignments were going to be graded. But an important lesson my parents taught me once I moved here to Indiana, United States was that I should always check PowerSchool and check what assignments am I missing.
